# Simple AI Chatbot

This is a simple AI chatbot project created using Python. The chatbot can respond to user queries based on a predefined dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Installing Required Libraries

To install the required libraries, you need to have `pip` installed. If `pip` is not installed, follow these steps:

1. Download `get-pip.py` using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    ```

2. Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python get-pip.py
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python3 get-pip.py
    ```

Once `pip` is installed, you can install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install nltk numpy scikit-learn
```

or

```bash
pip3 install nltk numpy scikit-learn
```

### Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. To create and activate a virtual environment, run:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
```

Then install the required libraries within the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install nltk numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-ai.git
    cd simple-ai
    ```

2. Ensure all required libraries are installed (as detailed above).

3. Run the chatbot script:

    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python3 chatbot.py
    ```

4. Interact with the chatbot in the terminal.

### Instructions to Add the README.md File

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/mukhammadsultanjurabekov/Desktop/simple-ai
    ```

3. Open a text editor to create the `README.md` file, or use a command-line editor like `nano`:

    ```bash
    nano README.md
    ```

4. Copy and paste the above markdown content into the file.
5. Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

### Initialize Git Repository and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already initialized a Git repository, you can do so and push it to GitHub:

1. Initialize a Git repository:

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2. Add your files to the repository:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3. Commit your changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4. Add the remote repository (replace `your-username` and `simple-ai` with your actual GitHub username and repository name):

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/simple-ai.git
    ```

5. Push your changes to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```
